									<h2>The Project</h2>
								</header>
								<p> WaveFunctionCollapse(WFC) algorithm, initially developed by <a href="https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse">Maxim Gumin</a> in 2016, 
									is an algorithm for procedural content generation (PCG). Inspired by the concept of wave function collapse in quantum mechanics, 
									WFC reduces the overall entropy of the system to generate 2D or 3D patterns using predefined tiles and connection rules.</p>
								<a class="image main"><img src="images/Figure 1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p> The basic mechanism of WFC aligns well with the characteristics of an underground parking layout. 
									This suggests that WFC is suitable for solving configuration problems related to underground parking layouts.
									Basic components of underground parking lots are represented as modules in WFC, 
									while the interconnections between these modules are represented as rules. 
									Once the modules and rules are defined, 
									WFC can generate underground parking layouts using input site information 
									(such as the plan outline and entrance locations).</p>
								<a class="image main"><img src="images/Figure 22.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p> We utilize <a href="https://monoceros.sub.digital/">Monoceros</a>, a Grasshopper plug-in developed by Subdigital
									Studio, to construct the generator. Monoceros aims to provide a comprehensive
									framework for integrating architectural or industrial design with WFC. This plug-in offers
									full control over input and output data in a Grasshopper-compatible manner while adhering
									to the principles of WFC. With the input of plan outlines and entrance locations, 
									architects can efficiently generate underground parking layouts on the Rhino platform.</p>

								<p> <b>Abstract:</b> During the design process, architectural layout configuration is subject to complex constraints such as site conditions and design requirements, resulting in limited design efficiency. This
									research aims to provide architects with an effective design tool that can generate reference-worthy
									underground parking layout solutions based on the given site information. In this research, we
									extract spatial modules from underground parking layouts, and transform the design constraints into
									adjacency rules based on the analysis of the configuration process for underground parking layout,
									then develop a generation and optimization model of the underground parking layout based on the
									WaveFunctionCollapse algorithm (WFC) and Multi-objective Optimization (MOO), and verify the
									effectiveness of the model through experiments. The results show that with given plan contour and
									entrance/exit locations as inputs, the model can efficiently generate architectural layout solutions
									that meet the design objectives.</p>
